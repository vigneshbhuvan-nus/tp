# 1. What is Green Tea? (Gabriel)

Green Tea is a **desktop app for learning a new language, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). This app is great for users who wish to optimise their time learning a new language,
but often struggle due to the difficulty of remembering new vocabulary. For many learners, vocabulary remains the most challenging aspect of learning a new language.
We felt that we could help learners struggling with vocabulary to learn the language more efficiently.
Therefore, Green Tea uses a proven memory retention system known as the [Leitner System](https://jessewhelan.medium.com/using-the-leitner-system-to-improve-your-study-d5edafae7f0)
and implements it in the context of a FlashCard game.

**Fun Fact:** You may be wondering, why did we choose the name Green Tea? Well, in the initial stages of development, the app was intended for users looking to learn Japanese, hence the name Green Tea.
Although the application now allows for the learning of [many languages](http://www.unicode.org/charts/index.html),
we kept the name Green Tea to denote the cultural journey a user undertakes when using this application.

In this User Guide (UG), you will learn about the various commands and
actions that would allow you to use Green Tea seamlessly and have an enjoyable journey with it.

# 2. About This Document (Gabriel)

Welcome to the Green Tea User Guide!

We at Green Tea are happy that you have taken your first few steps towards optimising your learning. We at Green Tea know that
learning a new language can be **hard** and **intimidating**. Trust us when we say we know **exactly** what you're
going through and we feel **frustrated** just as much you do.

That's why here at Green Tea, we have come up with this neat
user guide to help **you** hit the ground running. With this foolproof User Guide, learning a new
language will be as relaxing as drinking a hot cup of Green Tea.



# 3. Getting Started (Gabriel and Vignesh)

Greetings! This chapter will be on helping you get started with using Green Tea. In this chapter,
we will be covering installation, explanation of the GUI and basic commands needed to use Green Tea.

Before you can start using Green Tea, you will need to ensure that [Java 11](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) is installed on your computer.

To start using Green Tea:

1. Visit the Green Tea Releases Page [here](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T09-4/tp/releases)
2. Download GreenTea.jar from the latest release
3. Once downloaded, copy the jar file to your folder of choice (we recommend on your desktop!)
4. Double-Click the file to start the application. The GUI should appear in a few seconds and it should look like Figure 2.
There should be two sample decks for you to begin with, Japanese and Spanish.

![Green Tea](images/user-guide/1EmptyGUI.png)
Figure 2. Green Tea's GUI


Before we get started with the program, let us first understand the GUI of Green Tea. We shall use an annotated version of an empty GUI to explain it.
![Green Tea](images/user-guide/3EmptyGUIWithAnnotation.png)
Figure 3. Annotated GUI

We understand that you might be curious about each part of the GUI, don't worry, in this chapter we will briefly look through
every part of the GUI.

There are four main components to the GUI. The deck list, the tab panels, the result display and the command box

1.  `Deck List` - The deck list displays all the decks that you currently have in Green Tea.
    A deck is a list of entries and an entry consists of a word and a translation. It will update as you keep adding decks.
2.  `Tab Panels` - The main features of Green Tea are separated into tabs. The tabs will change automatically, depending on your
    commands, so you do not need to worry about changing the tabs manually. Green Tea currently has four different tabs.

    1. `Start Tab`: Consists of the welcome page that is shown on startup of the application.
    2. `Entries Tab`: Displays all the entries of a selected deck.
    3. `Quiz Tab`: Displays the current.
    4. `Statistics Tab`: Displays the score of your past attempts of the current selected deck or overall.

3.  `Result Display` - The result display is where the outcome of your commands are shown. Green Tea will feedback to you if your command has
    been successfully carried out, or if there are errors in your command formats.
4.  `Command Box` - The command box is where you type in your commands. Pressing **enter** on your keyboard will execute the commands.
5.  Try typing these commands to start playing with Green Tea

    - `new Japanese Animals`

    ![Green Tea](images/user-guide/4JapaneseAnimalDeck.PNG)
    Figure 4. New deck called Japanese Animals

    Your screen should now look like Figure 4. However, we have rewritten the exact command that we entered, into the `Command Box`. We will be
    doing this for the rest of the document as well!

    The previous command that you entered created a new Deck in Green Tea called `Japanese Animals`.
    Notice that the Deck List has been updated to include a new Deck called `Japanese Animals` with an index `3`.

    - `select 3`

    ![Green Tea](images/user-guide/5SelectDeckExample.png)
    Figure 5. Selecting the third deck in the list

    Your screen should now look like Figure 5.
    The previous command that you entered made Green Tea `select` the deck with index `3` which happens to be the Deck
    `Japanese Animals` that you have created previously. Notice that the current tab has automatically changed to the
    Entries Tab. The Entries Tab is empty because there are currently no entries in `Japanese Animals`. Let's fix that
    shall we?

    - `add w/Dolphin t/Iruka`

    ![Green Tea](images/user-guide/6AddEntryExample.png)
    Figure 6. Adding an Entry

    Your screen should now look like Figure 6.
    The previous command that you entered added a new Entry into the selected deck. The entry consists of
    the word `Dolphin` and the translation `Iruka`. Notice that the Entries Tab, which displays the current selected deck,
    has updated accordingly. Now, let us try editing the entry using the japanese characters for `Dolphin` instead
    of the translation `Iruka`.

    - `edit 1 t/イルカ`

    ![Green Tea](images/user-guide/7EditEntryExample.png)
    Figure 7. Editing an entry

    Your screen should look like Figure 7.
    The previous command that you entered modified the translation of the entry from `Iruka` to `イルカ`. Notice that now the
    first entry in the entries tab has the word `Dolphin` and the translation `イルカ`. Congratulations! You have
    now created a brand new deck called `Japanese Animals` with a new entry of the word `Dolphin` and the
    translation `イルカ`. Try adding a few more entries into Green Tea!

6.  Hopefully you have written a few more entries into Green Tea. We went ahead and added two new entries into the Deck
    `Japanese Animals`.

    ![Green Tea](images/user-guide/8AdditionalEntriesJapanese.PNG)
    Figure 8. Added more entries into `Japanese Animals`

    Figure 8 is a screenshot of our latest Deck containing the new entries that we have written.
    Now, let us try to play a game of FlashCards to memorise what we have written.
    Note than in our application, we use the terms Flashcards and Quizzes
    interchangeably. Try typing and entering the following commands into Green Tea.

    - `/play`

    ![Green Tea](images/user-guide/9PlayJapaneseDeck.PNG)
    Figure 9. Playing a Game of Flashcards


    Your screen should now look similar to Figure 9. However, the translation given on the left side of the Quiz Tab might be different
    depending on the entries you have written into `Japanese Animals`.

    The command you entered previously had switched Green Tea into Quiz mode. This means that all commands written from now on
    will be treated as answers to the question given by Green Tea. Also, note that the tab had switched to the Quiz Tab.

    From Figure 9, we can see that Green Tea is asking us the question "What is the english word for the translation `イルカ`?" We
    already know that the correct word is `Dolphin`. However, let us try typing a wrong answer for example`Dog`.

    ![Green Tea](images/user-guide/10WrongAnswer.PNG)
    Figure 10. Wrong answer given

    Green Tea has accepted the answer we had given it and has updated the translation shown on the Quiz Tab. Do take
    note that the right side of the Quiz Tab displays your history of answers to the quiz including the translation,
    the correct word/answer as well as the given answer.

    Finishing the quiz by answering the rest of the questions will bring you out of Quiz mode and you would be able
    to use your regular commands such as `/play` or `edit` again.

    Try playing the quiz a few more times!

7.  Have you tried quizzing yourself a few more times? Aren't you curious about your progress so far? Thankfully, Green Tea has been
    keeping track of your scores in the background and can display your statistics in the form of a graph. Try typing the following commands
    into Green Tea!

    - `stats 3`

    ![Green Tea](images/user-guide/11Statistics.PNG)
    Figure 11. Statistics of Deck 3

    Your screen should now look similar to Figure 11. The previous command that you entered changed the current tab
    into the Statistics Tab of Deck `3` which refers to the Deck `Japanese Animals`. In this tab, you can see
    your score history as well as the time stamp of each attempt. Based on our progression, we think we need a
    little bit more practise with our deck!

8.  Congratulations! We have come to the end of this chapter. We hope that you have learnt the basics of
    using Green Tea but if you are still itching to bring your learning to the next level, there are still a ton of
    commands with complete explanations to learn in [Chapter 5](#5-features).



# 4. Using This Guide (Melanie)

In this chapter, we will get familiar with the symbols and command format used in this user guide.

Before progressing further, we strongly recommend going through [Chapter 3](#3-getting-started-gabriel-and-vignesh) first.


## 4.1 Symbols

:information_source: This symbol represents important information

or `edit 1 [w/word] [t/translation]` **but cannot be written as** `edit 1`



# 5. Features

In this chapter, we will be going into detail of Green Tea's features, along with their command format and
relevant examples.


## 5.1 Deck Commands (Melanie)

## 5.2 Entry Commands (Gabriel)

Entries are what make up a deck. They are the words or phrases that you wish to memorise in Green Tea.
An entry is made up of two parts; the `word` and the `translation`. The `word` is written in the
language you are most familiar and the `translation` is written in the language you wish to learn. In
this User Guide, we will be assuming the language for `word` will be in English.

:information_source: **Note:**
Before you start giving entry commands, remember to [select a deck first!](#513-selecting-a-deck-select)

:bulb: Fun fact: Did you know Green Tea supports over 100 languages including Telugu, Welsh and Xamtanga? To
see if your chosen language is supported, click [here!](http://www.unicode.org/charts/index.html)


### 5.2.1 Adding a new entry: `add` (Vignesh)

## 5.3 Play Commands (Georgie)

Memory retention is the main goal of Green Tea. Thankfully, we have gotten rid of all
the complexities behind starting a new FlashCard game. In fact, there are only two commands in this section, `/play` and
`/stop`.


### 5.3.1 Playing a game (Georgie)

Plays the current deck. Green Tea will do a shuffle of the current deck and asks you what is the
the english `word` of a randomly selected `translation`. Your score will be recorded and displayed
to you at the end of the game.

Format: `/play`

:information_source: **Note:**
The slash `/` in the command.

:information_source: **Note:**
Before you start playing a new game, remember to [select a deck first!](#513-selecting-a-deck-select)

:information_source: **Note:** We have rewritten the exact command that we entered, into the `Command Box`.

Result:

## 5.5 Statistics (Melanie)

Statistics are how you get to see your own progression as you continuously build and play Green Tea.
The statistics tab displays the scores of games up to your last 10 attempts in the form of
a line graph.
You can view the statistics of a single deck or the statistics across all your decks.

To view statistics across **all** decks:

# 6. FAQ (Gabriel & Melanie)

**Q**: Will my score be recorded if I stop a game before I finish it?<br>
**A**: Your score will be displayed to you after you pass a `stop` command but it will not be recorded in the statistics tab

**Q**: Will all my data be saved when I exit Green Tea? <br>
**A**: Yes. All your data will be stores in a file called wordbank.json. This file can be found in the same folder where
you first installed Green Tea's [jar file](#3-getting-started-gabriel-and-vignesh)

**Q**: Where do I go to if I need help? <br>
**A**: Green Tea has an [issue page](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T09-4/tp/issues) where we will be monitoring for
any problems related to Green Tea. Feel free to create an issue to let us know if you require help!
