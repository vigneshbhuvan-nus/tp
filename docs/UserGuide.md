GreenTea is a **desktop app for learning a new language, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you like to use a FlashCard system to learn new languages, this app would be perfect for you. In this User Guide (UG), you will learn about the various commands and actions that would allow you to use GreenTea seamlessly.
